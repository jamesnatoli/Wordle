This is a repository for my version of the NYT game Wordle

This is designed for python 3 
To play, run
>> python test.py

To use different length words, use the -l or the --wordlength option
>> python test.py -l 8

You will need to have termcolor installed, which can be done via
>>pip install termcolor
